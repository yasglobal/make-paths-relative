Convert Absolute URLs to be relative in your fingertip.

== Description ==

This plugin can make(convert) the paths(URLs) to a relative instead of absolute. This plugin is useful for using relative URLs. The given below list of permalinks and src can be easily converted to a relative:

* Post Permalinks
* Archive Permalinks
* Author Permalinks
* Term Permalinks
* Scripts Paths(src)
* Styles Paths(src)
* Image Paths(src)

All the above permalinks and src can be converted to a relative instead of absolute by using this plugin. You can select the options from the plugin settings page.

= Filters =

If you want to exclude some Permalink or src to be relative then you can use `paths_relative` filter in your theme's `functions.php` or in your custom plugin.

Your filter may look like this (Below filter would make the `jquery.js` Path to absolute):

`
function yasglobal_change_path( $link ) {
  if( $link == '/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4' ) {
    $link = site_url().'/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4';
  }
  return $link;
}
add_filter( 'paths_relative', 'yasglobal_change_path' );
`

If you don't want to Make the Paths relative for srcset(Responsive Images) then just add the below-mentioned line in your theme's `functions.php`.

`
add_filter( 'srcset_paths_relative', '__return_false' );
`

If you want to make plugin works and all the paths relative without going to check/visit Settings Page so, just add this line in your theme's `functions.php`.

`
add_filter( 'make_paths_relative_activate_all', '__return_true' );
`

= Make sure to check the settings Page =
